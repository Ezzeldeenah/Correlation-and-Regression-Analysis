# Correlation-and-Regression-Analysis
## In this project the following have been done :
### 1- Using the Exam Results data, I prepared a scatter plot and computed the Pearson productmoment coefficient of correlation to assess the relationship between exam results and
attendance. also I Briefly commented on results and whether the Pearson measure is
statistically significant.
### 2- I Regressed exam results on attendance and the resulting output has been discussed. Including a discussion
of the statistical significance of the results and a brief analysis of the residuals and
outliers.
### 3- Forecating model to estimate the exam results Based on the regression estimated for each of the
following three students with the following attendance:
• Student A: 5%
• Student B: 55%
• Student C: 95%
### 4- , preparing a 2x2 contingency table and conducting a Chi-square
test of independence based on a normally distributed data for a vaccine.
